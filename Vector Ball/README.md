# Vector Ball

A fun game inspired by WikiBall where you traverse between word embeddings to get from one word to a target word.


## ToDo

 - [x] Create API for loading/building a ball-tree from a word list txt
 - [x] Create API for querying a ball tree with a point and receiving a word + its embedding
 - [x] Build an app model to hold state
 - [x] Build the query -> response game loop
 - [ ] Build the game view
 - [ ] Make a progress bar that represents dist to target word?
